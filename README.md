# Final Project

## Milestone 1 - Due 11/29/23

### Idea 1: DJ Table

I thought that creating an interactive DJ table would be a great way to combine the use of the Arduino, the audio library, and what I have learned in class so far. The image below shows my idea for the table setup, with two spinning records that each can play a different song. I would like to incorporate the Arduino board by having two buttons which can record scratch songs upon being clicked, and switch songs upon being pressed for about 5 seconds. Each button coordinates to a record. When the record is scratched, the records should spin back some and the song should also rewing a bit if possible. I would also like to incorporate some other features such as volume and speed control with sliders, a button that plays an 808 beat when clicked, and a audio visualizer.

### Idea 2: Tree Decoration and Santa Claus Wack-a-Mole

This idea consists of two games combined. One game is decorating a Christmas tree with bulbs and garland. The garland would be applied via dragging of the mouse while the bulbs would be randomly placed with the click of a button on the Arduino. I also had an idea to possiibly have LEDs light up on the board that correspond to the lights drawn in the picture below. The Santa game would be a Santa head which pops up randomly on the screen, and the user would have to click his face to score a point.
