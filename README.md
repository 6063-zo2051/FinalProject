# Final Project

## Milestone 1 - Due 11/29/23

### Idea 1: DJ Table

I thought that creating an interactive DJ table would be a great way to combine the use of the Arduino, the audio library, and what I have learned in class so far. The image below shows my idea for the table setup, with two spinning records that each can play a different song. I would like to incorporate the Arduino board by having two buttons which can record scratch songs upon being clicked, and switch songs upon being pressed for about 5 seconds. Each button coordinates to a record. When the record is scratched, the records should spin back some and the song should also rewing a bit if possible. I would also like to incorporate some other features such as volume and speed control with sliders, a button that plays an 808 beat when clicked, and a audio visualizer.

### Idea 2: Tree Decoration and Santa Claus Wack-a-Mole

This idea consists of two games combined. One game is decorating a Christmas tree with bulbs and garland. The garland would be applied via dragging of the mouse while the bulbs would be randomly placed with the click of a button on the Arduino. I also had an idea to possiibly have LEDs light up on the board that correspond to the lights drawn in the picture below. The Santa game would be a Santa head which pops up randomly on the screen, and the user would have to click his face to score a point.

### Idea 3: Subway Game

This iddea is a game that challenges the palyer to cross the subway by jumping from car to car. The user can only enter and exit cars through the doors as shown in the image. The cars move across the screen and appear in random order on their tracks. When the player is on the car, their avatar will be shown moving with the train. I am not yet sure how I would like the avatar to look. There is also a feature where the user can ride a rat. I would like for the rat to also move across the screen at random points. Once the player reaches the other side of the racks, possibly a screen with a trophy or reward could popup. I would like to incorporate the Arduino by having 4 buttons that move the avatar forward, back, left, or right upon being clicked.
